# PyTrakt3000

This module is designed to be a Pythonic interface to the [Trakt.tv](http://trakt.tv).
REST API, the official documentation for which can be found [here](http://docs.trakt.apiary.io/#).
trakt contains interfaces to all of the Trakt.tv functionality in an, ideally, easily
scriptable fashion.

This is a fork of the PyTrakt package by Elan Ruusam√§e at [https://github.com/glensc/python-pytrakt](https://github.com/glensc/python-pytrakt).

For more information on this module's contents and example usages
please see Elan's excellent [PyTrakt docs](https://glensc.github.io/python-pytrakt/).

## Contributing

I don't really plan to implement any pull requests because I mainly just wanted to add some features that I wanted, such as access to the History part of the API. You might want to fork this or make pull requests against Elan's version at [https://github.com/glensc/python-pytrakt](https://github.com/glensc/python-pytrakt).
